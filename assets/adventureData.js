Our Long Crossing was an intense journey from the charming village of Å to Delp, packing every aspect of a true thru-hike into those 100+ miles.<br/><br/>We hiked late into the midnight sun, traversed island-sized bogs with unbelievable views, faced intense and unpredictable weather, and marveled at the largest sundews I’ve ever seen. The trail was full of wild experiences, from getting bitten by a dog, catching ferries, to hitching a ride through an underwater tunnel.<br/><br/>Each day brought a mix of brutal elevation and jaw dropping moments surrounded by incredible beauty. The midnight sun painted the sky in hues of pink and orange, creating a magical atmosphere unlike anywhere else on earth.<br/><br/>It was a true adventure, one packed with unforgettable sights, thrills, and the kind of raw wilderness moments that stay with you forever."

    copy: "Spanning the mountains across the northeastern United States, the Northeast 115 is a formidable challenge, one that had us questioning our life choices more than once. But I love a good list. Lists take you places you’d never otherwise think to go, and they give you a reason to get out the door, even when it’s raining sideways or your legs are toast.<br/><br/>Over four years, this list led us through charming small towns, up rugged peaks, and into conversations with people we never would’ve met otherwise. We saw parts of the Northeast we didn’t even know existed, and came away with a deep appreciation for the region’s wild beauty and wonderfully stubborn hikers."

At the time, I thought that was ridiculous. The Long Trail is slow, rugged, and often pointlessly hard. But now, having scrambled all over the Adirondacks, I know exactly what he meant. To my own amazement, I’ve found myself saying <em>Vermont has great trails</em> with total sincerity, if I forget things like the PCT exist<br><br>I wouldn’t recommend the Adirondacks to everyone. The terrain is tough, the trails are barely trails in places, and the mud is a lifestyle. But the Dacks are something special: remote, wild, and stunningly beautiful. I swore I was done when we finished the 46, and of course, I’ve already been back again."

Hiking this little trail on Christmas Day gave us a rare kind of peace. With the crowds gone for the season, we had the path almost entirely to ourselves, and the island felt even more magical.<br><br>It may have only taken a few hours, but the memory of walking between two iconic towns, with the sea below and bells ringing in the distance, is one I’ll always carry with me. A short hike, but a special one."

This time, we hit summits we skipped on our original thru-hike, and explored new corners of New England we might’ve otherwise missed.<br><br> It was a great reminder that chasing big goals is really about enjoying all the small milestones in between."

Instead of a planned southbound hike of the Laugavegur and Fimmvörðuháls trails, we pivoted to starting in Þórsmörk, heading north to Landmannalaugar, and eventually making our way back south to Skogar. Initially dropped off in the midst of a storm, our motivation to tackle the Icelandic wilderness was far from apparent. Yet, as the sun emerged, so did the breathtaking scenery — neon green landscapes, volcanic black expanses, and blue glaciers that filled me with joy and stole my heart. From steam vents and hot springs to multicolored mountains, wild glaciers, volcanoes, and endless waterfalls, this relatively short trail packed a punch.<br><br>The experience was nothing short of magical, and I'm immensely grateful that we could embark on this unforgettable trek.",

The Appalachian Trail intersected with many of these summits, yet during my AT journey, I hesitated to expend precious energy on bagging peaks that, at the time, didn't seem particularly valuable. Nevertheless, the Whites stand out as the jewels of the East Coast, and more often than not, I find joy in having prioritized standing atop their tallest peaks.<br><br>Admittedly, these mountains are undeniably tough, some seemingly for no reason at all.
