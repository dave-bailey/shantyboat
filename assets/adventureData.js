    copy: "Growing up in Tennessee, a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail (AT) seemed like a distant, almost too-crazy-to-say dream.<br><br>I distinctly recall intentionally avoiding the AT while in the Smokies, reserving it in my mind as something to be touched later, saved for a future endeavor. After swearing off any longer hikes following the John Muir Trail (JMT) and residing in Asheville, NC, beneath the looming presence of the AT, the inevitable allure shifted from dream to a concrete plan.<br><br>Opting for a northbound (NOBO) thru-hike with one of our best friends, we embarked on what was supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, only to discover that thru-hiking would become the norm rather than a singular moment. The AT sparked sentiments of both 'I could do this forever' and 'I never want to do this again.' It encapsulated the essence of a thru-hike, an experience truly comprehensible only through firsthand participation. Although I don't have intentions to rehike the AT, it stands as a pivotal chapter in my life, a remarkable moment that propelled me to traverse thousands of miles and pursue numerous dreams that once seemed beyond reach.",

Straddling the line between savoring the present moment and the determination to realize a long-awaited dream, the CDT proved to be both incredibly difficult and astonishingly beautiful.

The prospect of hiking 211 miles through the Sierra was both daunting and exhilarating, pushing the boundaries of my outdoor experience, which until then had been limited to one-night peak bagging trips. Reflecting on that three-week expedition, the bulkiness of our gear and our limited daily mileage now appears quaint and almost comical. Yet, that journey opened the doors to the world of thru-hiking and long-distance travel—a realm that has since become a profound source of joy and fulfillment in my life.<br><br>The John Muir Trail, with its awe-inspiring landscapes and challenges, will forever hold a special place in my heart, and I carry the certainty that I will return to it someday.",

Instead of a planned southbound hike of the Laugavegur and Fimmvörðuháls trails, we pivoted to starting in Þórsmörk, heading north to Landmannalaugar, and eventually making our way back south to Skogar. Initially dropped off in the midst of a storm, our motivation to tackle the Icelandic wilderness was far from apparent. Yet, as the sun emerged, so did the breathtaking scenery — neon green landscapes, volcanic black expanses, and blue glaciers that filled me with joy and stole my heart. From steam vents and hot springs to multicolored mountains, wild glaciers, volcanoes, and endless waterfalls, this relatively short trail packed a punch.<br><br>The experience was nothing short of magical, and I'm immensely grateful that we could embark on this unforgettable trek.",

The Appalachian Trail intersected with many of these summits, yet during my AT journey, I hesitated to expend precious energy on bagging peaks that, at the time, didn't seem particularly valuable. Nevertheless, the Whites stand out as the jewels of the East Coast, and more often than not, I find joy in having prioritized standing atop their tallest peaks.<br><br>Admittedly, these mountains are undeniably tough, some seemingly for no reason at all. However, I relish the excuse for a challenge, savor the time spent with my wife, and revel in discovering new wonders right outside our doorstep.",

What captivates me about peak bagging is its ability to whisk you away to the less-prioritized corners of the mountains, introducing new adventures that might have otherwise slipped under the radar. The Southeast has been my home for the majority of my life, and this pursuit has granted me an intimate knowledge and connection to the Southern Appalachian mountains.<br><br>It was amidst the summits of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park that we unexpectedly encountered the NOBO bubble on the Appalachian Trail, sparking a 'dare-we-speak-it' desire of attempting a thru-hike of the AT.
